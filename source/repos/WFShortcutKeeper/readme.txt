This app written with using WinForm allows You to save passwords and different URL's or anything you want in 
encrypted database. I's using XOR encryption, so it doesn't support cyrillic alphabet. All the URLs and Description/
Passwords should be in English. You can register as many accounts as you want using self-made registration system and
save different information using different accounts. Also, the first registered account in this program has access to 
administration panel. That means that You can manage and delete every different account and get its logins and passwords.
	This is my first WinForm app and I tried to recreate an interface by myself and don't use native Windows UI.
	
Encryption key is my lastname. If you find any bugs feel free to write me anywhere.

In this project I used:
- Async/await
- Entity Framework
- Working with DataGridView
- BindingList
- LINQ
- Variable DB query
- ref/out variables in methods
- XOR Encryption
